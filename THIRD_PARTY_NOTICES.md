# Third-Party Notices

This plugin **vendors** (embeds) the following open-source components from the
[CitroLabs/ego-lite](https://github.com/CitroLabs/ego-lite) project (MIT License),
including the Linux port work in [PR #234](https://github.com/citrolabs/ego-lite/pull/234)
(`package/ego-linux`):

| Vendored component | Source | License |
|---|---|---|
| `runtime/ego-browser/dist/out/index.js` | shared ego-browser harness build (`package/ego-browser`) | MIT |
| `runtime/ego-linux/*` | Linux CDP host (`package/ego-linux`, PR #234) + local proxy patch | MIT |
| `runtime/skills/ego-browser/*` | agent skill package (`skills/ego-browser`) | MIT |

> Historical note: releases before v0.9.0 offered an optional managed FFmpeg
> download for the removed realtime preview backend (GPL-3.0-or-later builds
> from BtbN / ffmpeg-static). No FFmpeg code or download capability remains in
> this tree.

Additional local modifications on top of upstream (see `runtime/ego-linux/src/chrome.mjs`):
- `EGO_LINUX_PROXY` support: injects `--proxy-server` / `--proxy-bypass-list` into the
  launched Chrome, so the agent browser can reach the network through a local proxy
  without hijacking the CLI's own loopback CDP traffic.
